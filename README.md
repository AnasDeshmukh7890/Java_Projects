Jewelry Management System (JMS) is a software application designed to manage various aspects of jewelry sales and inventory. This system can handle tasks such as tracking inventory, processing sales, managing suppliers, and generating reports.
Objective:
To develop a comprehensive Jewelry Management System using Java, which will help jewelry businesses manage their inventory, sales, suppliers, and customer interactions efficiently.

Core Functionalities
Inventory Management:

Add Jewelry Items: Allows users to add new jewelry items with details such as ID, name, type (e.g., ring, necklace), price, and stock quantity.
Update Jewelry Items: Enables updating details of existing items, such as adjusting the price or quantity.
Delete Jewelry Items: Facilitates the removal of items from the inventory.
View Inventory: Provides a list or a detailed view of all jewelry items currently in stock.
Sales Management:

Process Sales: Handles sales transactions by updating the stock quantity and recording transaction details.
Generate Sales Reports: Produces reports detailing sales statistics, including total sales, items sold, and revenue.
Supplier Management:

Add Suppliers: Allows users to add new suppliers with details like ID, name, contact information, and address.
Update Supplier Information: Enables updating contact information or other details of existing suppliers.
View Suppliers: Provides a list or detailed view of all suppliers.
Customer Management:

Add Customers: Allows the addition of new customers with relevant details such as ID, name, and contact information.
Update Customer Information: Facilitates the updating of customer details.
View Customers: Provides a list or detailed view of all registered customers.
Reporting:

Inventory Report: Generates reports on current inventory levels, including low-stock warnings.
Sales Report: Produces sales reports for different time periods (daily, monthly, yearly).
Supplier Report: Provides details on supplier performance and orders.
High-Level Architecture
User Interface (UI):

Swing/AWT: Use Java Swing or AWT for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application.
JavaFX: Alternatively, JavaFX can be used for a more modern and flexible UI design.
Business Logic Layer:

Classes: Define classes for different entities such as JewelryItem, Sale, Supplier, and Customer.
Methods: Implement methods for operations like adding, updating, and deleting items and processing sales.
Data Access Layer:

Database Connection: Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
DAO Classes: Implement Data Access Object (DAO) classes to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Database:

Tables: Design tables for storing jewelry items, sales transactions, suppliers, and customers.
Schema: Define the database schema with appropriate relationships and constraints.
Exception Handling:

Implement robust exception handling to manage errors and ensure the system remains stable during operations.
Testing:

Unit Testing: Use JUnit or similar frameworks for unit testing individual components.
Integration Testing: Test the integration of different system components to ensure they work together as expected.
Summary
The Jewelry Management System project in Java aims to streamline the management of jewelry inventory, sales, suppliers, and customers. By utilizing Java's robust features and frameworks, this system will provide a user-friendly interface, efficient data management, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. The system is designed to be scalable and adaptable to different business needs, ensuring it remains useful as the business grows.
